# cs370 Term Project

## Description
When everybody was younger they anxiously waited by the mailbox hoping that their Hogwarts would be delivered. Since we are unable to make that a possibilty for our youngerselves we developed a program using Docker and Containerization that prompts the user for a word and then sends the word to the server. On the server side an api request is sent in order to find the sentences that contain the word. It is then sent back to the Client side and displayed on the website. It works like magic but it's not. 

## Usage

## Docker
